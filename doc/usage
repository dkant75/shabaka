### TO CALL:
`
shabaka mask.nrrd [options]
`  
where *mask.nrrd* is an image segmentation (mask) provided by the user.  

#### Options:   
* -nXXX: specify desired surface points following surface
      reconstruction step, denoted here as XXX. The number of surface points
      should typically be on the order of 25000.  
* -dYYY: specify Voronoi site pair distance (for Voronoi-based surface
      reconstruction), denoted here as YYY. Typically not to be changed.  
* -tZZZ: call tetgen to produce tetrahedral volume mesh from surface generated
      by Shabaka. The string ZZZ is the set of tetgen options (Refer to 
      http://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen). If ZZZ is not specified,
      default tetgen options are -pqY  
* -k: output tetrahedral volume mesh in VTK format. Requires -t flag to be
      called as well  
* -b: output tetrahedral volume mesh in Abaqus .inp format. Requires -t flag
      to be called as well  
* -l: (lowercase L) generate linear tetrahedra (default is quadratic). 
      Requires -t flag to be called as well  
* -v: run Shabaka in verbose mode  
* -a: export all intermediate files  
* -s: perform smoothing on point cloud (should not typically be necessary)  
* -p: perform Screened Poisson surface reconstruction instead of default
      Voronoi-based surface reconstruction  
* -f: overwrite any previously existing Shabaka output files        

Options should be separated by a space, and should have no whitespace
between the flag and value, exactly as shown in the example call.  

#### RECOMMENDED CALL:  
`
shabaka mask.nrrd -n30000 -d1.1 -tpqY -k -b
`  
Generates 30,000 surface points, uses Voronoi site pair distance of 1.1,
and generates quadratic tetrahedra in Tetgen, VTK, and Abaqus formats.
Tetgen options are -pqY.

#### Other examples: 
`
shabaka mask.nrrd
`  
(Default) Generates 30,000 surface points and uses Voronoi site pair distance
of 1.1. No tetrahedral meshing, verbose mode off, no intermediate files
exported, point cloud smoothing off, and Voronoi-based surface reconstruction
performed.
  
`
shabaka mask.nrrd -s -v -l -t -k
`  
Generates 30,000 surface points, uses Voronoi site pair distance of 1.1,
smooths point cloud, verbose mode on, generates linear tetrahedra in
Tetgen and VTK formats. Tetgen options are -pqY.
  
`
shabaka mask.nrrd -n25000 -p -a -f
`  
Generates 25,000 surface points, performs Screened Poisson surface
reconstruction, and exports all intermediate files. Overwrites previously
existing Shabaka output files.
  
  
### WALL CLOCK TIME:
Surface meshes can be generated for the provided datasets in less than 5
minutes on a 4 x 2.4 GHz CPU. Images involving complex interfaces or in-plane
resolutions higher than 256 x 256 pixels may take slightly more time.  


### OUTPUT:  
###### The following are output upon calling Shabaka:  
* .ply - watertight b-rep in Stanford PLY format  
* .stl - same file in STL format  

###### If -t is flag included, additionally:  
* -tetgen - subdirectory that includes all tetgen output files  

###### If -k is flag included, additionally:
* .vtk - tetrahedral mesh in legacy VTK format

###### If -b is flag included, additionally:
* .inp - tetrahedral mesh in Abaqus .inp format

###### If -a is flag included, additionally:  
* -ptcloud.ply - point cloud used for surface reconstruction, in PLY
  format  
* .xyz - Voronoi sites in XYZ format  
* .vor - Voronoi partition output from Qhull  
* -fine.ply - triangulated b-rep prior to surface decimation in PLY
  format  
  
Results may be inspected in Meshlab and/or Paraview. They can be opened from
the Start menu, or alternatively, if using Mac or Linux, by opening a terminal
and typing `meshlab` to open Meshlab and `paraview` to open Paraview.
